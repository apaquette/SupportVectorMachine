    "This notebook will explore Support Vector Machine by going through the CRISP-DM process. The goal is to gain insight of how to use SVM in Python and their usefulness. This notebook will be borrowing from Anand Prabhakar's notebook [Python-Support-vector-machines](https://github.com/ipython-books/cookbook-2nd-code/blob/master/chapter08_ml/05_svm.ipynb) on the same topic. I highly recommend you read his notebook."

Since our goal is to categorize the apples as good or bad quality, it is likely that ripeness will be a good label to make this prediction. However we may want to experiment with the other labels to determine which"
